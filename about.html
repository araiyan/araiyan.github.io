            <h1>About</h1>
            <h3>Raiyan</h3>
            <p>I was born in Bangladesh and lived there for most of my life. Once I was 12 years old I moved to the United States and attended middleschool. From a young age I knew I wanted to be a software engineer when I grow up, so when I started attending highschool I started persuing my interest in programming as a hobby. After about 3 years of programming I decided to make my own coding club and teach my fellow classmates how to program in Java.</p>
            <p>I soon moved on to making my first physics simulation on perfectly elastic collision after taking AP Physics in highschool. At that time I was very interested in physics so I started playing this game called Space Engineers. After playing that game for 4 months I wanted to make a script to manage my inventory and explore how to use document code. So I made my first game script in inventory management for Spacee Engineers. Soon afterwords Minecraft became popular and I made a minecraft plugin that makes cows float and explode with the use of a new game item called wand.</p>
